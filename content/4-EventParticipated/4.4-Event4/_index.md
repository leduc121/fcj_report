* Walk through practical examples of designing Agentic Workflows on AWS
* Highlight CloudThinker’s orchestration approach and context optimization methods
* Provide hands-on practice in building agent-based applications using AWS Bedrock
* Create opportunities to connect with professionals in the AI and cloud community

### Speakers

* Nguyen Gia Hung – Head of Solutions Architect, AWS
* Kien Nguyen – Solutions Architect, AWS
* Viet Pham – Founder & CEO, Diaflow
* Thang Ton – Co-founder & COO, CloudThinker
* Henry Bui – Head of Engineering, CloudThinker
* Kha Van – Community Leader, AWS

### Key Highlights

#### The Evolution of Agentic AI

**Traditional ML / Classical AI**

* Narrowly defined tasks and limited capabilities
* Depend heavily on structured datasets and preprocessing
* Difficult to scale or adapt to new use cases

**Modern Agentic AI**

* Powered by Foundation Models with multi-step reasoning
* Automatically breaks down tasks and leverages tools
* Capable of API integration, workflow execution, and knowledge access
* Becomes highly adaptable and production-ready when combined with AWS services

#### Challenges in Deploying Agentic AI

* Performance concerns such as latency, parallel reasoning, and throughput
* Scalability for multi-agent execution and complex context handling
* Security requirements including data control, identity flow, and access permissions
* Governance needs like logging, traceability, and workflow boundaries

#### AWS Agentic AI Portfolio

* Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for identity, memory, runtime, tool access, and workflows
* Agent Gateway for unified tool and API integration
* Broad model support including Anthropic, Meta Llama, Amazon Titan, and others
* Enterprise-focused design with guardrails, observability, and scaling features

#### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

* Runtime for orchestrating multi-step tasks
* Memory for both short-term and long-term context
* Identity Flow to manage permissions and security
* Agent Gateway for connecting to tools, APIs, and enterprise systems
* Code Interpreter for secure code execution
* Browser Tool for retrieving external information
* Observability features including logs, traces, and metrics

#### Building Agentic Workflow on AWS (Diaflow Use Case)

* Coordination between multiple agents
* Context lookup and function calling
* Integrating agents with internal data systems
* Executing business logic using Bedrock and Diaflow tools
* Practical design strategies suitable for startups and SMEs

#### CloudThinker Orchestration & Context Optimization

* High-level coordination patterns for agent systems
* Context filtering to improve model efficiency
* Adaptive workflows that change based on agent insights
* Techniques to evaluate and strengthen reasoning reliability
* Integration of CloudThinker workflows with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

#### CloudThinker Hack: Hands-On Session

* Initial setup of Bedrock agents
* Building a simple agent-driven workflow
* Adding external tools into the pipeline
* Troubleshooting and refining agent behavior
* Deploying a functional proof-of-concept

### Key Takeaways

#### Agentic AI Mindset

* AI is progressing from passive responses to autonomous action
* Effective agents combine memory, tools, identity, and orchestration
* Foundation Models + workflow control lead to next-generation AI solutions
* AWS currently offers one of the most production-ready environments for agentic development

#### Technical Understanding

* Why context optimization matters
* How tool usage and identity management influence reliability
* How AgentCore simplifies multi-step reasoning
* The importance of practical orchestration patterns
* Methods for connecting models with APIs, logic layers, and data sources

##### Practical Development Skills

* Designing a full AI workflow from end to end
* Integrating external tools into an agent pipeline
* Coordinating multiple agents effectively
* Managing latency, scaling, and security aspects
* Deploying agents with proper guardrails and monitoring

##### Applying to Work

Participants can directly use these skills to:

* Build assistants, automation flows, or internal copilots
* Connect Bedrock models with enterprise platforms
* Develop structured, multi-step workflows with AgentCore
* Create prototypes quickly without heavy DevOps requirements
* Apply CloudThinker orchestration methods to boost performance
* Use agentic design patterns in both startup and enterprise environments

### Event Experience

The “Agentic Build AI – Optimization with Amazon Bedrock” workshop provided a comprehensive look into modern agentic AI development.

#### Knowledge from Industry Experts
