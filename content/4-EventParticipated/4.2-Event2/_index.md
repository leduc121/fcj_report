# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1”

### Event Objectives

* Deliver practical knowledge on AWS Bedrock and modern AI development workflows
* Introduce core concepts of foundation models and effective prompt engineering
* Demonstrate RAG pipelines and embedding-based search techniques
* Present widely used AWS AI services for real-world solutions
* Explain AgentCore and how to architect production-ready GenAI applications

### Speakers

* **Lam Tuan Kiet** – Senior DevOps Engineer, FPT Software
* **Dang Hoang Hieu Nghi** – AI Engineer, Reonova Cloud
* **Dinh Le Hoang Anh** – Cloud Engineer Trainee, FCJ
* **Kha** – Offered guidance on building product-focused projects for stronger CVs
* **FPT Representative** – Shared examples of companies using cloud-based AI for cost efficiency and optimization

### Key Highlights

#### Foundation Models & Industry Direction

* Traditional ML models are task-specific and depend heavily on labeled training data.
* Foundation models in GenAI are trained on vast unlabeled datasets, enabling flexible multi-task performance.
* AWS Bedrock now supports models such as **OpenAI** and **DeepSeek**.
* More companies are migrating AI workloads to the cloud to reduce operational overhead.

#### Insights from Lam Tuan Kiet

* Provided an overview of the shift from classical ML → foundation models.
* Highlighted the role of prompt engineering in producing high-quality model outputs.
* Showed how Bedrock removes DevOps complexity when accessing state-of-the-art models.
* Stressed that creating AI products requires continuous iteration, skill, and responsible practices.

#### Prompt Engineering

* **Zero-shot prompting** – Very little context; output may be generic.
* **Few-shot prompting** – Included examples help guide clearer and more accurate responses.
* **Chain-of-thought prompting** – Encourages step-by-step reasoning for improved detail and correctness.

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Retrieves relevant information from external data sources.
* Combines retrieved context with the original prompt automatically.
* Produces more reliable and context-aware responses.

#### Embeddings

* Converts text into vector representations capturing semantic meaning.
* Similar concepts appear close together in vector space.
* **AWS Titan Text Embeddings** offer multilingual support across 100+ languages.

#### AWS AI Services

* **Rekognition** – Image/video analysis
* **Translate** – Multi-language translation
* **Textract** – Text and layout extraction
* **Transcribe** – Speech-to-text with speaker identification
* **Polly** – Natural text-to-speech
* **Comprehend** – NLP, entity extraction, and relationship detection
* **Kendra** – Smart enterprise search
* **Lookout Family** – Anomaly detection for metrics, equipment, and vision
* **Personalize** – Real-time recommendations
* **Pipecat** – Framework for AI agent pipelines

All services are accessible via APIs for integration into applications.

#### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

* Enables building AI-powered applications without heavy infrastructure or DevOps burdens.
* Compatible with modern agent frameworks such as **LangGraph** and **LangChain**.
* Designed to help teams transition from prototype → production quickly and securely.

**Core Components**

* Runtime
* Memory
* Identity
* Gateway
* Code Interpreter
* Browser Tool
* Observability

### Key Takeaways

#### AI Development Mindset

* Practical product building delivers far greater value than completing academic tasks.
* Foundation models support rapid experimentation, iteration, and deployment.
* Prompt engineering remains critical for achieving high-quality outputs.

#### Technical Impact

* RAG boosts accuracy by grounding responses in real documents.
* Embeddings enhance semantic search and intelligent retrieval.
* AWS AI services support full AI workflows—from speech and vision to document and language tasks.

#### Real-World Relevance

* Organizations are adopting cloud-based AI to cut costs and scale faster.
* Skills in prompt engineering, embeddings, and Bedrock services are increasingly in-demand.
