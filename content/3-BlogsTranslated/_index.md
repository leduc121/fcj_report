This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

###  [Blog 1 - Reimagining Mental Healthcare: Technology as a Catalyst for Change](3.1-Blog1/)
The blog argues that mental healthcare is at a breaking point—long waitlists, provider burnout, and limited access—and shows how cloud-based and AI-powered technologies on AWS are already transforming the field. It highlights real-world examples like Talkspace (teletherapy + AI matching & documentation), Netsmart (generative AI progress notes via Amazon Bedrock & HealthScribe), Gaggle ReachOut (24/7 student crisis hotline on Amazon Connect + Lex), Stop Soldier Suicide’s predictive analytics, and wellness apps like Headspace and Calm. Together, these solutions expand access, reduce clinician administrative burden by hours per week, enable proactive risk detection, and shift mental health from reactive to preventive—all while preserving the human therapeutic connection.

###  [Blog 2 -CrazyGames upgrades platform with real-time friends system using AWS AppSync](3.2-Blog2/)
The blog highlights how CrazyGames, a browser-based gaming platform with 35M+ monthly players, dramatically upgraded its social experience by launching a real-time friends system using AWS AppSync. What originally would have taken 8 months was delivered in just 8 weeks. Players can now instantly add friends, see online status, view what games their friends are playing, and send invites—all powered by AppSync’s managed GraphQL and real-time subscriptions. Combined with Amazon MemoryDB for Redis (transient data) and Amazon Aurora (persistent data), the solution handles tens of thousands of concurrent users with near-zero latency and minimal operational overhead..

###  [Blog 3 - Intelligent document processing at scale with generative AI and Amazon Bedrock Data Automation](3.3-Blog3/)
The blog introduces a fully open-source, production-ready Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) solution powered by Amazon Bedrock Data Automation — AWS's new managed service for extracting structured insights from unstructured documents, images, and other multimodal content at scale. It provides a complete end-to-end pipeline (with intuitive web UI, Step Functions orchestration, and CDK deployment) that allows users to simply upload documents and define desired fields to get accurate structured tables back, with minimal effort and no prompt engineering. The solution also supports fallback paths using raw Bedrock LLMs or Textract for maximum flexibility.

###  [Blog 4 - ...](3.4-Blog4/)
This blog introduces how to start building a data lake in the healthcare sector by applying a microservices architecture.
