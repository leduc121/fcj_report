Starting from **September 8, 2025**, my internship period at AWS officially began. Over the next four months, the experience unfolded like an adventurous journey into unfamiliar horizons. It was not just a place where I went to the office, checked in, and went home. Instead, it became a landscape of learning—filled with valuable knowledge, practical experience, mentorship, and engaging lab activities.

I was fortunate to join the **Online Platform for Tracking and Predicting Hurricane Trajectory** project with the *SKYNET* team as a backend engineer. Together, we developed a platform aimed at delivering timely and critical storm-related information to internet users. With further expansion and wider adoption, the system has the potential to significantly reduce loss of life and property during natural disasters.

Through this meaningful journey, I strengthened key skills such as:

* Building stable and reliable web platforms
* Planning for fallback and backup scenarios in case of system failures
* Applying AWS Cloud services to design and maintain the system infrastructure
* Gaining additional experience and best practices related to DevSecOps

I am truly grateful for the opportunity to work with this team and create a complete, impactful product alongside such wonderful colleagues.
