### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  

There are far more things to praise than to criticize about the working environment. First of all, the workplace is clean, spacious, and comfortable. However, there is no drinking water outside the pantry, so it would be great if interns were allowed to get filtered water to drink.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin** 

The mentors are excellent—enthusiastic, dedicated, and genuinely supportive throughout the internship. All of my questions were answered quickly and thoroughly. The mentors also regularly checked on my progress and offered helpful advice so I could complete my tasks in the best possible way.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  

Since my software engineering major focuses on web and application development, AWS is a very suitable choice and aligns well with my field of study. It can greatly support my future career growth. I hope that one day I can apply and become a full-time AWS employee.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  

I learned how to design architectures using AWS services, deploy infrastructure, and work with it to turn a plan into a fully functioning product. It’s something I’m proud of, although there is still a lot to improve. This is definitely not the final stop on my Cloud Journey.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  

The company culture is good. However, there is one point worth emphasizing: Mentors should avoid making sarcastic remarks about interns who request leave for certain reasons before an event. Because there is a good chance that their reasons are genuine. We may privately form assumptions, but we should not express those assumptions out loud without evidence. We value a culture of learning and long-term teamwork—not sarcasm that undermines others. I’m not referring to any specific person, nor am I generalizing. I myself have never requested leave for any event, but I still want to mention this for the sake of building a better community.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  

The main benefit is the opportunity to learn and complete the internship. Personally, I did not expect much in terms of benefits, because nowadays most relationships operate on an exchange of value rather than giving without expecting anything in return. I have not yet contributed anything that generates value for AWS, so I do not expect a salary or anything more. I’m already happy to be here and experience the working environment.

### Additional Questions

- My strongest impression is probably having the chance to work in a group with wonderful teammates.

- I would consider recommending AWS as an internship destination for SE students from my university.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- I hope interns can use the pantry to drink water.

- I may stay longer to earn the internship certificate and gain more experience so that someday I can apply for a full-time position.
