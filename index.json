That world isn\u0026rsquo;t just possible—it\u0026rsquo;s already here.\nTechnology is reshaping the mental healthcare landscape. AI-powered assistants now help to relieve clinicians of paperwork burdens, surface breakthrough insights, and improve efficiency. Meanwhile, digital platforms are connecting individuals with care that once seemed inaccessible. What we are witnessing isn\u0026rsquo;t just innovation—it\u0026rsquo;s a revolution, with the potential to heal not only patients, but an overstretched, overwhelmed healthcare system.\nA System at its Breaking Point Let\u0026rsquo;s face it: the mental healthcare system is cracking under pressure.\nNearly half of Americans who need mental health services are unable to access them. Providers are booked for months—if they\u0026rsquo;re accepting new patients at all. Individuals seeking help often face an exhausting process of calling down therapist lists, only to settle for appointments that conflict with work or require long commutes.\nOn the other side of the equation, clinicians are struggling. They are drowning in administrative work—documentation, billing, compliance—that steals time away from direct care. It\u0026rsquo;s a major contributor to provider burnout, pushing passionate professionals out of the field entirely. The result is a perfect storm: patients can\u0026rsquo;t access care, and the professionals who could help are stretched beyond capacity.\nDigital Solutions: Alleviating the Pressure Digital technologies, built on secure, scalable infrastructure, offer real and sustainable solutions to the industry\u0026rsquo;s most pressing challenges:\nTeletherapy platforms and mobile mental health applications: Expand access to convenient care options. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms: Improve accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, and personalize treatment—improving quality of care and outcomes. Digital intake and automated documentation systems: Streamline administrative tasks—allowing providers to spend more time with patients and help reduce burnout. Online peer support and counseling: Engage marginalized populations unlikely to use other mental health services, while relieving provider shortage pressures. These technological innovations increase the accessibility and affordability of mental health care. They also empower individuals to take a more active role in managing their mental well-being through self-help tools and continuous support.\nBridging Gaps in Care with Virtual Services Access to mental healthcare has long been hindered by provider shortages, transportation barriers, and stigma. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposed the urgency of overcoming these obstacles—and virtual care emerged as a critical bridge.\nTalkspace, a U.S.-based digital therapy platform, exemplifies this shift. Built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), it delivers secure, scalable access to licensed therapists through web and mobile applications. Talkspace enables synchronous and asynchronous communication, giving users the flexibility to access care how and when they need it.\nIn addition to making care more accessible, Talkspace is alleviating the administrative burden for its providers by reducing the time spent on documentation. They facilitated progress notes providers can clinically review before using, enabling them to quickly create session reports and summaries and easily visualize a patient\u0026rsquo;s progress over a specific period. This has saved providers an average of 10 minutes per session or approximately three to four hours per week in administrative tasks at full-time utilization.\nMaking Access Easier through National Digital Health Front Doors Globally, health systems are leveraging cloud-based digital platforms to widen access. Nations have built \u0026lsquo;digital health front doors\u0026rsquo;—single entry points citizens can use to more easily access healthcare information and digital services.\nHealthdirect Australia, funded by the Australian Federal, State and Territory governments, provides mental health resources and services via phone, web, and a mobile app, designed to help people make informed decisions about their health and access appropriate care. Services include 24/7 nurse-staffed helplines, a national practitioner directory, symptom checkers, and virtual clinics—all powered by AWS and its partners. The National Health Service of England (NHS) has launched NHS login, a serverless identity platform that enables citizens to access a range of healthcare services, including mental health care, via the NHS app. Built on AWS, it delivers secure, highly available access to critical services for millions of users. A Path Forward for Healthcare Professionals For mental health providers, these innovations offer more than operational efficiency—they offer relief. Automated systems reduce clerical burdens. Telehealth tools extend reach. Secure platforms protect patient privacy and streamline service delivery. And most importantly, clinicians can return their focus to what matters most: helping individuals heal. Technology is not replacing the human connection at the heart of mental health care—it\u0026rsquo;s reinforcing it.\nMaking Clinical Care More Effective In addition to promoting access to care, technology can also play an important role in improving the effectiveness of treatment. AI-powered clinical decision support and predictive insights can enable better clinical decisions, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.\nTalkspace uses AWS services to build and deploy machine learning (ML) models to match each user with a mental health professional best suited to meet their individual needs—maximizing the probability of success. Talkspace also provides a diagnostic profile of each patient and provides helpful insights, such as potential secondary conditions.\nA key aspect of clinical success is patient retention and regularity of follow up sessions, as the threshold for clinical improvement is several sessions of therapy. ML-assisted features provide therapists with recommended tips and actions to avoid early dropout and to retain patients. ML models are also used to identify behavioral patterns and potential harm risks, sending push notifications to therapists in real time if elevated risk is detected.\nProviding for Communities in Need Predictive models are not just for individual patients. They can also proactively identify risks within a community and help in the development of programs designed to improve outcomes for specific populations.\nStop Soldier Suicide is a nonprofit organization addressing the issue of suicide among US veterans and service members. In order to understand its data better and gain new insights, the organization worked with AWS Partner Pariveda to implement the Suicide Intelligence Platform (SIP). The platform ingests forensic device data, integrates it with health cloud data, and stores it in an AWS-based data lake. Using the SIP solution, Stop Soldier Suicide can ingest and enrich data from multiple sources to better predict the risk of veteran suicide and help clinicians mitigate that risk.\nThe organization started the Black Box Project, which employs digital forensics to collect and process data from smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar devices of Veterans who have died by suicide. It also supplements that information with open-source intelligence from the Veteran\u0026rsquo;s last year of life. Machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and entity extraction techniques (powered by AWS) are then used to build models of pre-suicidal behaviors highly correlated with suicide. This uncovers novel insights that can be shared with the veteran-serving community to save lives at scale.\nGaggle, an education technology company and AWS Partner, strives to keep K-12 students safe and reduce the risk of student suicide by identifying students at risk, and providing them with the resources they need. Gaggle Safety uses machine learning to flag concerning content in students\u0026rsquo; school-issued accounts for review and blocks potentially harmful content. This helps K-12 school districts monitor early warning signs so they can take action to protect students from harming themselves or others.\nGaggle also developed ReachOut, a 24/7 mental health hotline built on AWS, that connects K-12 students to trained Gaggle support counselors, anywhere, anytime. Continuous support is made possible by using Amazon Connect, an AI-native contact center from AWS. ReachOut also uses Amazon Lex, an AI Chat Builder with advanced natural language models that can support ReachOut Responders in different languages.\nDriving Greater Efficiency for Service Providers Technology can help drive efficiencies for service providers by automating undifferentiated tasks—allowing providers to focus on taking care of patients. Automation tools are streamlining documentation processes, allowing clinicians to spend less time on paperwork. AI-powered diagnostic tools are also assisting in rapid, accurate assessments, and advanced predictive modeling is enabling timely clinical interventions before conditions worsen.\nNetsmart is a leading provider of health information technology solutions, including electronic health records (EHRs), augmented intelligence and automation for providers of behavioral health and post-acute care services. Recognizing the importance of enabling providers to spend more time taking care of individuals, Netsmart developed solutions with advanced capabilities designed to alleviate the burden of documentation. Using AWS services like Amazon Chime SDK, AWS HealthScribe and large language models (LLMs) available through Amazon Bedrock, Netsmart is able to take the conversations that providers have with individuals and translate the narrative and unstructured content into clinical progress notes.\nThe use of generative AI capabilities, through Amazon Bedrock, has enabled Netsmart to build their solutions faster. Leveraging cutting edge foundational models, like Anthropic\u0026rsquo;s Claude, and enriching them with proprietary data sets enables Netsmart to securely deliver summarizations and progress notes, reducing the documentation burden for providers.\nAdditionally, Bells Quality Coach provides audit scoring for completed notes, empowering quality assurance and improvement (QA/QI) teams to identify gaps and potential risks. It automates reviews, providing actionable insights to support organizations in delivering high-quality, compliant care. By taking a meaningful approach to AI and automation technologies, Netsmart aims to empower staff, optimize processes and simplify reimbursement.\nFurthermore, Netsmart has partnered with AWS to build a first-of-its-kind AI Data Lab that speeds up innovation, allowing Netsmart to rapidly deploy new technology and capabilities. Using data amassed from EHRs and health plan claims, the algorithm can identify an individual\u0026rsquo;s risk factors, with the goal to reduce hospital admissions.\nThe AI Data Lab is also taking on a project for natural language processing (NLP) that starts with real-time translation for non-English speaking case managers. It will also handle automating paper records into structured data that can help identify individual needs.\nThe Netsmart CareManager™ population health management platform enables access to real-time data from multiple sources, such as EHRs, claims data and more. It is powered by AWS for scalability and near real-time analytics, including machine learning. This facilitates predictive modeling to prioritize both reactive and proactive actions, enabling providers to target at-risk individuals based on social determinants of health data and tailor interventions to their needs. It provides real-time alerts driven by predictive analytics, covering everything from potential hospitalizations to Medicaid costs.\nAlternatives to Live Provider Services Another way in which technology can address the gap between increasing demand and limited supply of qualified mental health providers, is by providing digital alternatives to live provider services. These could include evidence-based, self-guided digital therapy sessions, as well as access to virtual communities that create safe spaces for connection to peer support.\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, evidence-based and digitally administered therapeutics including Digital Cognitive Behavior Therapy can form an important alternative, or adjunct, to live services for treatment of several mental health conditions. In addition to reducing the demand on providers, such services can also offer additional convenience to users who can access the service on demand. This can help address challenges associated with the perceived stigma in accessing these services.\nTalkspace offers an option for self-guided therapy where an individualized digital program is created for users based on their input and using content from Talkspace\u0026rsquo;s more than 60 clinically-proven guided counseling programs. Each program is delivered in several five-minute-long sessions designed to make progress within important clinical areas identified for the specific individual user.\nSupportiv connects users with others who share their struggles in small, peer-to-peer support groups for live chats, each guided by a trained moderator. An AI-driven matching system ensures users are placed in the most suitable group based on their specific concerns. Additionally, Supportiv offers personalized mental health resources through an AI-powered recommendation engine. A dedicated AI algorithm continuously monitors conversations for crisis signals. If a potential crisis is detected, the system alerts a moderator to intervene following a predefined clinical protocol.\nTo facilitate inclusivity, Supportiv leverages AWS translation services as the foundation for its advanced multi-lingual support, enabling real-time language adaptation. AWS Cloud services also help Supportiv scale dynamically based on user demand, providing high availability and a seamless user experience. The reliability and resilience of AWS infrastructure are particularly crucial for crisis monitoring, where any delay in detection or response could have serious consequences.\nPreventive Care Digital health tools hold great promise in their ability to transform mental healthcare from reactive to proactive by empowering individuals to manage their psychological well-being with the same deliberate attention given to physical health. Democratization of access to mindfulness applications with adaptive algorithms that respond to individual progress and preferences puts mental well-being at the fingertips of every digitally-connected individual.\nTo help create a future of de-stigmatized mental health awareness, Headspace built technology to bring meditation and mental health tools into the palms of the public. Headspace is an application that helps its users learn to meditate and live more mindfully. With thousands of themed meditation and mindfulness exercises focusing on everything from stress and sleep to fear of flying and focus, the goal of the app is to help its users live in the present moment without judgement. With millions of users on the app simultaneously, Headspace, with the help of AWS, is relieved from the upkeep of the application, skipping over the \u0026ldquo;technology plumbing,\u0026rdquo; and allowing them to give their time to business and mission-driven work. Even during events where Headspace usage is higher than usual, users continue to get a great experience on the application because of its ability to scale up to meet the demands of a high volume of visitors. Headspace also uses services from an AWS Partner – Auth0 by Okta – to deliver a secure and scalable identity solution to grow and support its millions of subscribers across 200 countries and regions.\nCalm, a top-rated sleep, meditation, and relaxation app, has more than 100 million global user downloads. The app uses AWS machine learning and APIs to help communicate requests and responses, allowing Calm to generate tailored, quality recommendations to users. Calm fosters relaxation by offering videos on mindful movement and gentle stretching, audio guides led by mindfulness experts, and audio and visual scenes from nature.\nCelebrities are getting on board, too, with Lebron James, Harry Styles, and Ariana Grande contributing to Calm\u0026rsquo;s content library. The app uses Amazon Personalize—a service that lets developers build applications with ML technology to create recommendations that deliver customer-preferred content. Content generated by Amazon Personalize led to a 3.4 percent uptick in daily mindfulness practice among members of the Calm community.\nConclusion The integration of technology into mental health services represents a paradigm shift in how we access and deliver psychological care. The most profound advancements will likely emerge from hybrid models that thoughtfully blend technological efficiency with human empathy. The future of mental healthcare lies between digital and traditional approaches, in their strategic integration—creating a more accessible and effective system that meets the diverse needs of an increasingly complex global society.\nBy transcending traditional barriers of geography, stigma, and resource limitations, digital innovations are democratizing access to mental healthcare while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.\nLearn more about AWS Partners or contact an AWS Representative to discover how you can create new healthcare innovations that drive better outcomes.\nFurther Reading TeleHealth on AWS AWS HealthScribe Amazon Lex – AI Chat Builder TAGS: AWS Partners\nAbout the Author Jay Rajda, MD, is a Physician Executive for Global Healthcare at AWS, where he is responsible for helping global government health agencies and healthcare payers adopt technology solutions to meet their strategic objectives.

Whether playing through a desktop or mobile device, all gamers can now enjoy an enhanced social experience with a new real-time friends system built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) AppSync.\nCrazyGames has been all-in on AWS since day one, running on a single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance when it was initially built in 2014. Since then, the platform has grown organically and now hosts more than 3,000 games spanning different genres. Reflecting on the role AWS has played in the company’s continued evolution, CrazyGames Founder and CEO Raf Mertens noted:\n“AWS offers a wide range of highly available, scalable services that we can try, test and use effortlessly within a very short period of time. By using AWS AppSync, we reduced our development time from eight months to eight weeks.”\nBoosting the social experience Playing games with friends is infinitely more fun than playing solo and can help players level up their skills. Thankfully, social games provide opportunities to forge new friendships with people who share similar interests while also reinforcing existing bonds. Multiplayer games with strong social components also provide benefits. They tend to better engage players, increase long-term retention, and draw in new users as players invite their friends.\nUntil recently, CrazyGames visitors couldn’t always easily play with friends. They faced a disjointed experience, which inspired the company to design and implement its new friends system. Now, users can befriend one another, see when their friends are online, view the games they are playing, and send game invites in real time.\nTo develop the friends feature, CrazyGames used the ‘shape up’ methodology, which entailed establishing a small, dedicated team solely focused on creation of a production-ready friends system. The developers built the new functionality using AWS AppSync, which coordinates the status of multiple users in near real time. Players can see right away when their friends log on or off.\nAt the start of development, the team also investigated an open-source framework and a custom solution built using the WebSocket API before selecting AWS AppSync.\n“Users today expect immediate gratification, so real-time operations are essential. AWS AppSync emerged as the ideal solution for our friend system. It required less development effort due to its abstraction over WebSocket API, was more cost-effective compared to other options, and seamlessly integrated with our existing GraphQL client,” explained Mertens. “AWS AppSync covered all we needed, so the setup was effortless, and it’s continued to perform well as it handles tens of thousands of simultaneous users with real-time status updates.”\nIn addition to AWS AppSync, CrazyGames uses Amazon Aurora for managing long-lived data, such as notifications, in the new friend system. For more transient data that requires rapid updates, like invites and user statuses, the company uses Redis Cloud on AWS, with Amazon MemoryDB.\nBuilding with AWS With a decade of history working with AWS, CrazyGames has evolved its technology ecosystem to include a wide range of AWS solutions and services. This helps its team focus on software development instead of building, configuring, and maintaining servers. Last year, the company implemented a new analytics system to gain additional insight into user behaviors and needs. The analytics system efficiently tracks millions of daily events across its platform’s more than two million daily users as they interact with complex features.\n“Most of the AWS services we’ve chosen handle operational responsibilities like availability and maintenance. This means our team can spend more time on software development,” said Mertens. “Moreover, our platform is subject to traffic spikes, and since our compute power is scalable, these surges are automatically absorbed by the backend without downtime or latency.”\nCurrently, CrazyGames has integrated the new friends system within 30 games on their platform, ranging from first-person shooters such as Kour.io to classics such as 8 Ball Pool Billiards. As they plan to roll the friend system out more widely in the next 12 months, the company is looking to streamline the onboarding experience. Mertens shared, “Once users know the new friend feature exists, they really love it, but we still have to guide them through specific steps to get started. We want to make that process easier for them.”\nPlanning for the next new feature By leveraging AWS, CrazyGames developers can quickly and cost-efficiently experience new features, helping the company to maintain its reputation as a top destination for engaging, web-based social games. Mertens concluded:\n“With AWS managed services, we can build more features with our time, instead of dealing with infrastructure management. Plus, there’s a huge risk reduction. You can experiment and get new features live faster to figure out whether they work, instead of wasting engineering resources.”\nLearn more about building entertaining, scalable experiences with speed and flexibility.

It not only powers the machine learning model but is also directly displayed to end users so they can monitor the most recent storms in the West Pacific region. Because of this dual purpose—model training and real-time visualization—we carefully investigated multiple reliable and authoritative sources before selecting a single dataset that met all of our requirements: Hurricane Data from NOAA.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a scientific agency under the U.S. Department of Commerce. NOAA provides highly accurate, research-grade environmental data, including global weather observations, satellite imagery, and tropical cyclone records. With decades of investment in advanced technologies such as geostationary satellites, ocean buoys, radar systems, and climate monitoring networks, NOAA is widely regarded as one of the most trustworthy providers of hurricane information in the world.\nFor this project, we specifically use data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)—a NOAA-led project and the world’s most comprehensive tropical cyclone dataset. IBTrACS consolidates and unifies historical and modern storm-track data from multiple meteorological agencies (e.g., JTWC, JMA, CMA, NHC). By merging these sources into a single consistent format, it improves inter-agency comparability and ensures researchers worldwide have access to the best available storm-track information.\nThe version of the dataset we use contains 226,153 rows of hurricane observations. Each row includes a variety of valuable fields such as:\nsid – storm ID number – storm number basin / subbasin – regional classification nature – storm type (e.g., tropical storm, typhoon) iso_time – timestamp lat / lon – storm center coordinates … and many additional meteorological properties However, for our machine learning model, we focus only on four key columns: sid, iso_time, lat, and lon. These form the essential time-series trajectory used to predict storm movement.\nThe dataset spans storms recorded from 1870 up to 2025, filtered to include only those within the West Pacific region—our geographical focus. The raw dataset can be accessed publicly here: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/vnm-ibtracs-tropical-storm-tracks#\nCleaning and Physics-Informed Feature Engineering One advantage of IBTrACS is that it is already well-maintained and consistent. Only minimal preprocessing is needed, primarily the removal of missing values.\nAfter cleaning, we apply our first step of physics-informed machine learning—a technique that injects physical knowledge directly into the data pipeline. From the latitude–longitude coordinates, we compute two additional features using the Haversine formula:\nDistance between consecutive storm points Bearing (direction of movement) These features are physically meaningful: they represent real-world movement patterns instead of arbitrary transformations. They enrich the dataset by giving the model more context about the storm’s momentum and direction, thereby improving learning efficiency and prediction accuracy.\nFigure 1 : Dataset Description Data for Display The data used for display on the platform is different from the data used for training, even though both originate from NOAA. The training dataset is static and historical, but the display dataset must always reflect the current storm conditions.\nTo achieve this, we implement a scheduled AWS Lambda function that automatically retrieves the latest storm-track updates at the end of each day. This ensures that the platform always presents the most recent and accurate information to users.\nThe processed display data is stored as a JSON file in an Amazon S3 bucket. When a user accesses the website:\nThe frontend sends a request to API Gateway API Gateway triggers the appropriate Lambda function The Lambda function fetches the JSON from S3 The resulting data is returned to the user for visualization This pipeline guarantees real-time, serverless, cost-effective data delivery.\nThe live dataset used for display can be accessed here: https://ncics.org/ibtracs/\nFigure 2 : Web to crawl data "},{"uri":"https://github.com/leduc121/fcj_report/2-proposal/","title":"Proposal","tags":[],"description":"","content":"🌪️ Typhoon Path Prediction Website (AWS Serverless Architecture) I.

(Elizaveta) Zinovyeva, Nuno Castro, Ozioma Uzoegwu, Eren Tuncer, and Zainab Afolabi | on 11 JUL 2025 | in Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Bedrock Data Automation, Generative AI, Intermediate (200), Technical How-to | Permalink | Comments | Share\nExtracting information from unstructured documents at scale is a recurring business task. Common use cases include creating product feature tables from descriptions, extracting metadata from documents, and analyzing legal contracts, customer reviews, news articles, and more. A classic approach to extracting information from text is named entity recognition (NER). NER identifies entities from predefined categories, such as persons and organizations. Although various AI services and solutions support NER, this approach is limited to text documents and only supports a fixed set of entities. Furthermore, classic NER models can’t handle other data types such as numeric scores (such as sentiment) or free-form text (such as summary). Generative AI unlocks these possibilities without costly data annotation or model training, enabling more comprehensive intelligent document processing (IDP).\nAWS recently announced the general availability of Amazon Bedrock Data Automation, a feature of Amazon Bedrock that automates the generation of valuable insights from unstructured multimodal content such as documents, images, video, and audio. This service offers pre-built capabilities for IDP and information extraction through a unified API, alleviating the need for complex prompt engineering or fine-tuning, and making it an excellent choice for document processing workflows at scale. To learn more about Amazon Bedrock Data Automation, refer to Simplify multimodal generative AI with Amazon Bedrock Data Automation.\nAmazon Bedrock Data Automation is the recommended approach for IDP use case due to its simplicity, industry-leading accuracy, and managed service capabilities. It handles the complexity of document parsing, context management, and model selection automatically, so developers can focus on their business logic rather than IDP implementation details.\nAlthough Amazon Bedrock Data Automation meets most IDP needs, some organizations require additional customization in their IDP pipelines. For example, companies might need to use self-hosted foundation models (FMs) for IDP due to regulatory requirements. Some customers have builder teams who might prefer to maintain full control over the IDP pipeline instead of using a managed service. Finally, organizations might operate in AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is not available (available in us-west-2 and us-east-1 as of June 2025). In such cases, builders might use Amazon Bedrock FMs directly or perform optical character recognition (OCR) with Amazon Textract.\nThis post presents an end-to-end IDP application powered by Amazon Bedrock Data Automation and other AWS services. It provides a reusable AWS infrastructure as code (IaC) that deploys an IDP pipeline and provides an intuitive UI for transforming documents into structured tables at scale. The application only requires the user to provide the input documents (such as contracts or emails) and a list of attributes to be extracted. It then performs IDP with generative AI.\nThe application code and deployment instructions are available on GitHub under the MIT license.\nSolution overview The IDP solution presented in this post is deployed as IaC using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). Amazon Bedrock Data Automation serves as the primary engine for information extraction. For cases requiring further customization, the solution also provides alternative processing paths using Amazon Bedrock FMs and Amazon Textract integration.\nWe use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the IDP workflow and parallelize processing for multiple documents. As part of the workflow, we use AWS Lambda functions to call Amazon Bedrock Data Automation or Amazon Textract and Amazon Bedrock (depending on the selected parsing mode). Processed documents and extracted attributes are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).\nA Step Functions workflow with the business logic is invoked through an API call performed using an AWS SDK. We also build a containerized web application running on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) that is available to end-users through Amazon CloudFront to simplify their interaction with the solution. We use Amazon Cognito for authentication and secure access to the APIs.\nThe following diagram illustrates the architecture and workflow of the IDP solution.\nThe IDP workflow includes the following steps:\nA user logs in to the web application using credentials managed by Amazon Cognito, selects input documents, and defines the fields to be extracted from them in the UI. Optionally, the user can specify the parsing mode, LLM to use, and other settings. The user starts the IDP pipeline. The application creates a pre-signed S3 URL for the documents and uploads them to Amazon S3. The application triggers Step Functions to start the state machine with the S3 URIs and IDP settings as inputs. The Map state starts to process the documents concurrently. Depending on the document type and the parsing mode, it branches to different Lambda functions that perform IDP, save results to Amazon S3, and send them back to the UI: Amazon Bedrock Data Automation: Documents are directed to the “Run Data Automation” Lambda function. The Lambda function creates a blueprint with the user-defined fields schema and launches an asynchronous Amazon Bedrock Data Automation job. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation handles the complexity of document processing and attribute extraction using optimized prompts and models. When the job results are ready, they’re saved to Amazon S3 and sent back to the UI. This approach provides the best balance of accuracy, ease of use, and scalability for most IDP use cases. Amazon Textract: If the user specifies Amazon Textract as a parsing mode, the IDP pipeline splits into two steps. First, the “Perform OCR” Lambda function is invoked to run an asynchronous document analysis job. The OCR outputs are processed using the amazon-textract-textractor library and formatted as Markdown. Second, the text is passed to the “Extract attributes” Lambda function (Step 6), which invokes an Amazon Bedrock FM given the text and the attributes schema. The outputs are saved to Amazon S3 and sent to the UI. Handling office documents: Documents with suffixes like .doc, .ppt, and .xls are processed by the “Parse office” Lambda function, which uses LangChain document loaders to extract the text content. The outputs are passed to the “Extract attributes” Lambda function (Step 6) to proceed with the IDP pipeline. If the user chooses an Amazon Bedrock FM for IDP, the document is sent to the “Extract attributes” Lambda function. It converts a document into a set of images, which are sent to a multimodal FM with the attributes schema as part of a custom prompt. It parses the LLM response to extract JSON outputs, saves them to Amazon S3, and sends it back to the UI. The web application checks the state machine execution results periodically and returns the extracted attributes to the user when they are available. Prerequisites You can deploy the IDP solution from your local computer or from an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. The deployment steps are detailed in the solution README file.\nIf you choose to deploy using a SageMaker notebook, which is recommended, you will need access to an AWS account with permissions to create and launch a SageMaker notebook instance.\nDeploy the solution To deploy the solution to your AWS account, complete the following steps:\nOpen the AWS Management Console and choose the Region in which you want to deploy the IDP solution.\nLaunch a SageMaker notebook instance. Provide the notebook instance name and notebook instance type, which you can set to ml.m5.large. Leave other options as default.\nNavigate to the Notebook instance and open the IAM role attached to the notebook. Open the role on the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console.\nAttach an inline policy to the role and insert the following policy JSON:\n{ \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;cloudformation:*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;s3:*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;iam:*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sts:AssumeRole\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;ssm:GetParameter\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ssm:GetParameters\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:ssm:*:*:parameter/cdk-bootstrap/*\u0026#34; } ] } When the notebook instance status is marked as InService, choose Open JupyterLab.\nIn the JupyterLab environment, choose File, New, and Terminal.\nClone the solution repository by running the following commands:\ncd SageMaker git clone [https://github.com/aws-samples/intelligent-document-processing-with-amazon-bedrock.git](https://github.com/aws-samples/intelligent-document-processing-with-amazon-bedrock.git) Navigate to the repository folder and run the script to install requirements:\ncd intelligent-document-processing-with-amazon-bedrock sh install_deps.sh Run the script to create a virtual environment and install dependencies:\nsh install_env.sh source .venv/bin/activate Within the repository folder, copy the config-example.yml to a config.yml to specify your stack name. Optionally, configure the services and indicate the modules you want to deploy (for example, to disable deploying a UI, change deploy_streamlit to False). Make sure you add your user email to the Amazon Cognito users list.\nConfigure Amazon Bedrock model access by opening the Amazon Bedrock console in the Region specified in the config.yml file. In the navigation pane, choose Model Access and make sure to enable access for the model IDs specified in config.yml.\nBootstrap and deploy the AWS CDK in your account:\ncdk bootstrap cdk deploy Note that this step may take some time, especially on the first deployment. Once deployment is complete, you should see the message as shown in the following screenshot. You can access the Streamlit frontend using the CloudFront distribution URL provided in the AWS CloudFormation outputs. The temporary login credentials will be sent to the email specified in config.yml during the deployment.\nUsing the solution This section guides you through two examples to showcase the IDP capabilities.\nExample 1: Analyzing financial documents In this scenario, we extract key features from a multi-page financial statement using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation. We use a sample document in PDF format with a mixture of tables, images, and text, and extract several financial metrics. Complete the following steps:\nUpload a document by attaching a file through the solution UI. On the Describe Attributes tab, either manually list the names and descriptions of the attributes or upload these fields in JSON format. We want to find the following metrics:\nCurrent cash in assets in 2018 Current cash in assets in 2019 Operating profit in 2018 Operating profit in 2019 Choose Extract attributes to start the IDP pipeline.\nThe provided attributes are integrated into a custom blueprint with the inferred attributes list, which is then used to invoke a data automation job on the uploaded documents. After the IDP pipeline is complete, you will see a table of results in the UI. It includes an index for each document in the _doc column, a column for each of the attributes you defined, and a file_name column that contains the document name. From the following statement excerpts, we can see that Amazon Bedrock Data Automation was able to correctly extract the values for current assets and operating profit.\nThe IDP solution is also able to do complex calculations beyond well-defined entities. Let’s say we want to calculate the following accounting metrics:\nLiquidity ratios (Current assets/Current liabilities) Working capitals (Current assets – Current liabilities) Revenue increase ((Revenue year 2/Revenue year 1) – 1) We define the attributes and their formulas as parts of the attributes’ schema. This time, we choose an Amazon Bedrock LLM as a parsing mode to demonstrate how the application can use a multimodal FM for IDP. When using an Amazon Bedrock LLM, starting the IDP pipeline will now combine the attributes and their description into a custom prompt template, which is sent to the LLM with the documents converted to images. As a user, you can specify the LLM powering the extraction and its inference parameters, such as temperature.\nThe output, including the full results, is shown in the following screenshot.\nExample 2: Processing customer emails In this scenario, we want to extract multiple features from a list of emails with customer complaints due to delays in product shipments using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation. For each email, we want to find the following:\nCustomer name Shipment ID Email language Email sentiment Shipment delay (in days) Summary of issue Suggested response Complete the following steps:\nUpload input emails as .txt files. You can download sample emails from GitHub. On the Describe Attributes tab, list names and descriptions of the attributes. You can add few-shot examples for some fields (such as delay) to explain to the LLM how these fields values should be extracted. You can do this by adding an example input and the expected output for the attribute to the description.\nChoose Extract attributes to start the IDP pipeline. The provided attributes and their descriptions will be integrated into a custom blueprint with the inferred attributes list, which is then used to invoke a data automation job on the uploaded documents. When the IDP pipeline is complete, you will see the results.\nThe application allows downloading the extraction results as a CSV or a JSON file. This makes it straightforward to use the results for downstream tasks, such as aggregating customer sentiment scores.\nPricing In this section, we calculate cost estimates for performing IDP on AWS with our solution.\nAmazon Bedrock Data Automation provides a transparent pricing schema depending on the input document size (number of pages, images, or minutes). When using Amazon Bedrock FMs, pricing depends on the number of input and output tokens used as part of the information extraction call. Finally, when using Amazon Textract, OCR is performed and priced separately based on the number of pages in the documents.\nUsing the preceding scenarios as examples, we can approximate the costs depending on the selected parsing mode. In the following table, we show costs using two datasets: 100 20-page financial documents, and 100 1-page customer emails. We ignore costs of Amazon ECS and Lambda.\nAWS service Use case 1 (100 20-page financial documents) Use case 2 (100 1-page customer emails) IDP option 1: Amazon Bedrock Data Automation Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (custom output) $20.00 $1.00 IDP option 2: Amazon Bedrock FM Amazon Bedrock (FM invocation, Anthropic’s Claude 4 Sonnet) $1.79 $0.09 IDP option 3: Amazon Textract and Amazon Bedrock FM Amazon Textract (document analysis job with layout) $30.00 $1.50 Amazon Bedrock (FM invocation, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet) $1.25 $0.06 Orchestration and storage (shared costs) Amazon S3 $0.02 $0.02 AWS CloudFront $0.09 $0.09 Amazon ECS – – AWS Lambda – – Total cost: Amazon Bedrock Data Automation $20.11 $1.11 Total cost: Amazon Bedrock FM $1.90 $0.20 Total cost: Amazon Textract and Amazon Bedrock FM $31.36 $1.67 The cost analysis suggests that using Amazon Bedrock FMs with a custom prompt template is a cost-effective method for IDP. However, this approach requires a bigger operational overhead, because the pipeline needs to be optimized depending on the LLM, and requires manual security and privacy management. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation offers a managed service that uses a choice of high-performing FMs through a single API.\nClean up To remove the deployed resources, complete the following steps:\nOn the AWS CloudFormation console, delete the created stack. Alternatively, run the following command: cdk destroy --region \u0026lt;YOUR_DEPLOY_REGION\u0026gt; On the Amazon Cognito console, delete the user pool. Conclusion Extracting information from unstructured documents at scale is a recurring business task. This post discussed an end-to-end IDP application that performs information extraction using multiple AWS services. The solution is powered by Amazon Bedrock Data Automation, which provides a fully managed service for generating insights from documents, images, audio, and video. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation handles the complexity of document processing and information extraction, optimizing for both performance and accuracy without requiring expertise in prompt engineering. For extended flexibility and customizability in specific scenarios, our solution also supports IDP using Amazon Bedrock custom LLM calls and Amazon Textract for OCR.\nThe solution supports multiple document types, including text, images, PDF, and Microsoft Office documents. At the time of writing, accurate understanding of information in documents rich with images, tables, and other visual elements is only available for PDF and images. We recommend converting complex Office documents to PDFs or images for best performance. Another solution limitation is the document size. As of June 2025, Amazon Bedrock Data Automation supports documents up to 20 pages for custom attributes extraction. When using custom Amazon Bedrock LLMs for IDP, the 300,000-token context window of Amazon Nova LLMs allows processing documents with up to roughly 225,000 words. To extract information from larger documents, you would currently need to split the file into multiple documents.\nIn the next versions of the IDP solution, we plan to keep adding support for state-of-the-art language models available through Amazon Bedrock and iterate on prompt engineering to further improve the extraction accuracy. We also plan to implement techniques for extending the size of supported documents and providing users with a precise indication of where exactly in the document the extracted information is coming from.\nTo get started with IDP with the described solution, refer to the GitHub repository. To learn more about Amazon Bedrock, refer to the documentation.\nAbout the authors Nikita Kozodoi, PhD, is a Senior Applied Scientist at the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, where he works on the frontier of AI research and business.

To put it simply, we use a sequence of past latitude and longitude values to predict the next latitude and longitude in the future.\nFeature Engineering After completing the data preprocessing stage, we split the dataset into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing. This is done by storm ID, ensuring that no storm appearing in the validation or test set is included in the training set. This prevents data leakage and ensures the reliability of evaluation results.\nFor model training, each input consists of a sequence of 4 consecutive time steps, where each step represents an observation interval of 3 hours. Thus, one input sequence covers a total of 9 hours of storm movement.\nFigure 1 : Dataset Distribution Applying Stepwise Temporal Fading Augmentation (STFA) To enhance the diversity of the training data, we apply our proposed method—Stepwise Temporal Fading Augmentation (STFA)—to 50% of the training set, selected based on unique storm IDs. The original sequences from these storms are replaced by their augmented counterparts, ensuring the final size of the training set remains unchanged (approximately 100% of the original size).\nAs introduced earlier in the proposal section, STFA modifies the older points in a sequence while keeping the most recent observations unchanged. For each 4-step sequence:\nThe latest 2 time steps remain the same The older 2 time steps are scaled using fading coefficients: [0.98,; 0.99] Although these values appear small, latitude and longitude are extremely sensitive features. Even a tiny change—such as from 6.7 to 6.8—can correspond to tens of kilometers of displacement in the real world. Therefore, using modest fading values is both logical and physically meaningful, ensuring the augmented data remains realistic.\nExample of STFA on a 4-Step Sequence Here is a simple example showing how a 4-step time-series sequence is transformed after applying STFA:\nRow Original (lat, lon) Augmented (lat, lon) Operation 1 [-6.8 , 107.5] [-6.66 , 105.35] multiplied by 0.98 2 [-7.0 , 107.1] [-6.93 , 106.03] multiplied by 0.99 3 [-7.3 , 106.7] [-7.3 , 106.7] unchanged 4 [-7.5 , 106.4] [-7.5 , 106.4] unchanged This process reduces the magnitude of older observations while keeping the recent ones intact. The augmentation introduces controlled variability, helping the model generalize better for trajectory forecasting.\nEarlier, we used physics-informed machine learning to compute distance and bearing between time steps using the Haversine formula. After STFA is applied, these values are recomputed based on the augmented coordinates. This guarantees that all physical features remain accurate and consistent with the updated trajectory.\nFigure 2 : Comparison of Augmentation Techniques on Storm Trajectories Model Setting 1.Physics-Informed Loss Our use of the Haversine formula does not end at feature engineering. In addition to generating distance and bearing values, we also incorporate the Haversine distance as a custom loss function, alongside traditional losses such as MSE, RMSE, and MAPE.\nBecause the Haversine formula computes the true geodesic distance between two geographical points, it serves as a natural metric for evaluating the error in the model’s predicted storm location. A larger Haversine distance indicates that the prediction is far from the true position, whereas a smaller value means the model is performing well. The optimal Haversine loss, ideally, is 0 km.\nThe formula was previously introduced in Section 2: Proposal, so we do not rewrite it here.\nExample:\nModel prediction: [-6.72, 107.1] True location: [-6.8, 107.5] Haversine loss: 45.06 km The value 45.06 km directly reflects the real-world positional error, making the loss physically interpretable.\nThis is what we refer to as physics-informed machine learning loss, where physical laws and domain knowledge guide the model’s optimization.\n2.Model Architect Sequence modeling tasks are traditionally handled by recurrent architectures such as RNNs, LSTMs, or GRUs. However, recent research has shown that convolution-based approaches can outperform these methods in many time-series applications.\nWhile CNNs do not inherently model sequence order, they excel at:\nextracting local spatial/temporal features parallel processing faster training stable gradients efficient scaling For our project, we adopt a convolution-based architecture as the foundation. Specifically, our main model is a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN).\nTemporal Convolutional Network (TCN) A TCN uses 1D dilated convolutions, enabling the model to have a receptive field that expands over time, allowing it to “see” far into the past without requiring recurrence.\nExample (sequence = [a, b, c, d]):\nLayer 1 (dilation = 1): model sees [d] Layer 2 (dilation = 2): model sees [b, d] Layer 3 (dilation = 4): model can see [a, b, c, d] By stacking dilated convolutions, the network learns long-range dependencies while retaining all the benefits of fast convolution operations. Thus, TCNs combine memory of the past with computational efficiency, making them an ideal choice for storm trajectory forecasting.\n3. Model Hyperparameters Below are the key hyperparameters used in our training configuration:\nInput dimensions: 4 (latitude, longitude, distance, bearing) Hidden units: 1024 Number of TCN layers: 2 Learning rate: 1e-4 Epochs: 80 Optimizer: Adam Early stopping: patience = 6 (based on overall loss) 4. Composite Loss Function Our main training loss is a weighted combination of multiple components:\nMSE on latitude and longitude MSE on distance and bearing (auxiliary features) Haversine loss (physics-informed component) The contribution of each auxiliary loss is controlled by weighting factors:\nλ_aux = 0.5 (for distance and bearing MSE) λ_hav = 0.3 (for the Haversine loss) This design ensures that the model:\nlearns to minimize coordinate errors, respects physical displacement, and does not overfit to any single feature. By integrating physics-informed loss terms with data-driven learning, the model becomes more stable, consistent, and aligned with real-world storm dynamics.\nFigure 3 : Training Process Evaluation After the training process concludes and the model triggers early stopping, performing an evaluation on the test set is necessary to determine whether the model generalizes well and is ready for real-world deployment. We evaluate the model using Overall Loss, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and Haversine distance to gain deeper insight into its performance:\nTotal Loss: 74.3849 MSE: 0.0832 RMSE: 0.2772 MAPE: 0.60% Haversine (km): 30.75 From these results, we observe that the average positional error is approximately 30 km from the true location. This level of error is acceptable because hurricanes are extremely large systems, often spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometers. The MSE of only 0.08 for latitude and longitude also indicates strong predictive accuracy, suggesting that the model can effectively estimate realistic future storm trajectories with minimal error.\nThese results further demonstrate that convolutional computations can perform very well on sequence-modeling tasks, and should be considered a strong alternative to traditional sequential architectures such as RNNs, LSTMs, or GRUs—not only for images but also for structured spatiotemporal data.\nWith the model validated, the next step is to upload the trained model to an Amazon S3 bucket and use an AWS Lambda function to load and execute it in response to user inference requests.\nThe following sections will focus on how we design and deploy our online prediction platform, making the hurricane trajectory model accessible for public use.\nFigure 4 : Evaluation Metrics "},{"uri":"https://github.com/leduc121/fcj_report/3-blogstranslated/","title":"Translated Blogs","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated.

Early detection and timely warnings are essential so that people in affected areas have enough time to prepare and evacuate safely.\nTo address this need, our project aims to build an online platform that allows users to freely access information about the most recent storms in the Western Pacific, using data sourced from the trusted NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). In addition, students, meteorologists, or anyone interested in hurricane dynamics can interact with our system by providing their own input trajectories and receiving predictions generated by our machine learning model.\nThis workshop presents the complete process of building such a model for hurricane forecasting, including several novel time-series techniques—Stepwise Temporal Fading and Plausible Geodesic-Aware Augmentation—as well as a step-by-step explanation of how we built and deployed the platform from scratch.\nWith the support of AWS services such as Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and CloudFront, we construct a fully serverless architecture. This offers simplicity, scalability, and long-term cost efficiency while ensuring reliable and responsive performance.\nPlatform Architecture The final platform delivers two core functionalities:\nStorm Viewing Users can explore up-to-date information on recent Western Pacific storms, including their historical path, wind speed, temperature, and other relevant parameters.\nHurricane Trajectory Prediction Users can input their own partial storm trajectory and receive a predicted future path generated by our trained model.\nContent Workshop overview Data Preparation ML Model Training Front\u0026amp;Back-End Architect API "},{"uri":"https://github.com/leduc121/fcj_report/5-workshop/5.5-platform-api/","title":"Platform API","tags":[],"description":"","content":"BACK-END API DETAIL DESCRIPTION Table of Contents Introduction System Architecture Core Features Technology Stack Project Structure API Endpoints 1.

Instead, it became a landscape of learning—filled with valuable knowledge, practical experience, mentorship, and engaging lab activities.\nI was fortunate to join the Online Platform for Tracking and Predicting Hurricane Trajectory project with the SKYNET team as a backend engineer. Together, we developed a platform aimed at delivering timely and critical storm-related information to internet users. With further expansion and wider adoption, the system has the potential to significantly reduce loss of life and property during natural disasters.\nThrough this meaningful journey, I strengthened key skills such as:\nBuilding stable and reliable web platforms Planning for fallback and backup scenarios in case of system failures Applying AWS Cloud services to design and maintain the system infrastructure Gaining additional experience and best practices related to DevSecOps I am truly grateful for the opportunity to work with this team and create a complete, impactful product alongside such wonderful colleagues.\nBelow is a more detailed self-assessment:\nNo. Criteria Description Good Fair Average 1 Professional knowledge \u0026amp; skills Understanding of the field, applying knowledge in practice, proficiency with tools, work quality ☐ ✅ ☐ 2 Ability to learn Ability to absorb new knowledge and learn quickly ☐ ✅ ☐ 3 Proactiveness Taking initiative, seeking out tasks without waiting for instructions ✅ ☐ ☐ 4 Sense of responsibility Completing tasks on time and ensuring quality ✅ ☐ ☐ 5 Discipline Adhering to schedules, rules, and work processes ✅ ☐ ☐ 6 Progressive mindset Willingness to receive feedback and improve oneself ☐ ✅ ☐ 7 Communication Presenting ideas and reporting work clearly ☐ ☐ ✅ 8 Teamwork Working effectively with colleagues and participating in teams ☐ ✅ ☐ 9 Professional conduct Respecting colleagues, partners, and the work environment ☐ ✅ ☐ 10 Problem-solving skills Identifying problems, proposing solutions, and showing creativity ✅ ☐ ☐ 11 Contribution to project/team Work effectiveness, innovative ideas, recognition from the team ✅ ☐ ☐ 12 Overall General evaluation of the entire internship period ✅ ☐ ☐ Needs Improvement Enhance my ability to use cloud services more efficiently to reduce costs and design optimized architectures\nImprove my communication skills and become more open, as I still tend to be quiet and introverted\n"},{"uri":"https://github.com/leduc121/fcj_report/1-worklog/1.6-week6/","title":"Week 6 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 6 Objectives: Learn to manage EC2 access using resource tags through IAM Understand cost optimization with Lambda automation Implement automated resource management Tasks to be carried out this week: Day Task Start Date Completion Date Reference Material 1 - Learn about resource tagging: + Tag best practices + Tag policies + Cost allocation tags + Tag-based access control 13/10/2024 13/10/2024 https://000028.awsstudygroup.com/ 2 - Learn IAM policies with tags: + Condition keys for tags + Tag-based permissions + Resource-level permissions - Practice: Create tag-based IAM policies 14/10/2024 14/10/2024 https://000028.awsstudygroup.com/ 3 - Practice: Manage EC2 access with tags: + Tag EC2 instances + Create IAM policies based on tags + Test access control + Verify permissions 15/10/2024 15/10/2024 https://000028.awsstudygroup.com/ 4 - Learn Lambda for cost optimization: + Lambda basics + Event-driven automation + CloudWatch Events/EventBridge + Lambda with EC2 API 16/10/2024 16/10/2024 AWS Lambda Documentation 5 - Practice: Optimize EC2 costs with Lambda: + Create Lambda function to stop idle instances + Schedule Lambda with EventBridge + Monitor and test automation + Calculate cost savings 17/10/2024 18/10/2024 AWS Lambda Documentation Week 6 Achievements: Resource Tagging:\nMastered AWS tagging best practices Understood tag naming conventions and strategies Learned about mandatory tags and tag policies Implemented cost allocation tags for billing Created comprehensive tagging strategy for organization IAM Tag-Based Access Control:\nLearned to use condition keys in IAM policies (aws:RequestTag, aws:ResourceTag) Created policies that grant access based on resource tags Implemented attribute-based access control (ABAC) Successfully managed EC2 access using resource tags Tested and verified tag-based permissions Lambda Automation:\nGained understanding of AWS Lambda serverless computing Learned event-driven architecture patterns Mastered Lambda function creation and deployment Understood Lambda execution roles and permissions Cost Optimization with Lambda:\nCreated Lambda functions to identify and stop idle EC2 instances Implemented automated scheduling with EventBridge Set up notifications for automated actions Monitored Lambda execution and costs Calculated actual cost savings from automation Automation Best Practices:\nLearned to implement safe automation with proper error handling Understood the importance of testing automation in non-production Implemented logging and monitoring for automated tasks Created documentation for automated processes "},{"uri":"https://github.com/leduc121/fcj_report/7-feedback/","title":"Sharing and Feedback","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Overall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThere are far more things to praise than to criticize about the working environment. First of all, the workplace is clean, spacious, and comfortable. However, there is no drinking water outside the pantry, so it would be great if interns were allowed to get filtered water to drink.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentors are excellent—enthusiastic, dedicated, and genuinely supportive throughout the internship. All of my questions were answered quickly and thoroughly. The mentors also regularly checked on my progress and offered helpful advice so I could complete my tasks in the best possible way.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nSince my software engineering major focuses on web and application development, AWS is a very suitable choice and aligns well with my field of study. It can greatly support my future career growth. I hope that one day I can apply and become a full-time AWS employee.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nI learned how to design architectures using AWS services, deploy infrastructure, and work with it to turn a plan into a fully functioning product. It’s something I’m proud of, although there is still a lot to improve. This is definitely not the final stop on my Cloud Journey.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is good. However, there is one point worth emphasizing: Mentors should avoid making sarcastic remarks about interns who request leave for certain reasons before an event. Because there is a good chance that their reasons are genuine. We may privately form assumptions, but we should not express those assumptions out loud without evidence. We value a culture of learning and long-term teamwork—not sarcasm that undermines others. I’m not referring to any specific person, nor am I generalizing. I myself have never requested leave for any event, but I still want to mention this for the sake of building a better community.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe main benefit is the opportunity to learn and complete the internship. Personally, I did not expect much in terms of benefits, because nowadays most relationships operate on an exchange of value rather than giving without expecting anything in return.
